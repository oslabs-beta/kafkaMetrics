// use this file to add console logs for rate metrics
// separate log for requestRate, timeoutRate, messageConsumptionRate
// define methods which pass in time, then setInterval to set that frequency
// default value of log frequency is period, user has option to pass in different argument
// figure out edge case if user tries to use logOn twice in a row
// store result of setInterval so we can turn log off later
// what happens in the case of disconnect?
